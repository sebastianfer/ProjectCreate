#Wall_Follow
The code sends an action to the robot and makes it follow any walls using 4 out of the 5 bumper sensors it has. The bumpers
detect being hit by the walls and that makes the robot move for a determined amount of time. If the wall ends, the robot will
turn to try to find more walls and keep following those.
